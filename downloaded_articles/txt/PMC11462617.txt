Abstract  
As in previous years, including 2023, a major focus in the neurooncological area of neuropathology was put on 
more precise and constantly faster diagnostic procedures, even reaching the level of ultra -fast intraoperative 
diagnostics based on methylation pr ofiling. Neuropathological diagnostic precision and clinical follow -up treat-
ment has been further increased by combining DNA methylation profiling with targeted panel sequencing. A few 
new, molecularly defined tumor subtypes have been proposed, among other s, a glioneuronal tumor with ATRX  
alteration, kinase fusion and anaplastic features (in its abbreviated form named GTAKA) and the de novo repli-
cation repair deficient glioblastoma, IDH -wildtype both having either distinct prognostic or therapeutic implica-
tions. Regarding the understanding of brain tumor development and progression, several novel mechanisms 
have been presented which might also be considered as treatment targets in the future, such as a) autonomous 
rhythmical Ca2+ oscillations in interconnect ed glioma cell networks driving tumor growth; b) transfer of mito-
chondria from normal astrocytes to glioma cells enhancing proliferation and self -renewal; c) brain endothelial 
cell remodeling upon matrix -metalloprotease 9 secretion by tumor cells metastasi zing into the CNS and d) anti -
tumor activity of microglia in CNS metastasis of breast cancer. Finally, in contrast to previous years, several very 
promising neurooncological treatment studies have been conducted, focusing on specific targets such as 
H3K27M  or IDH1/2 mutations for which a proper neuropathological assessment is key. The continuous transla-
tion of potential new treatment targets using faster and precise diagnostic procedures will further pave the way 
for better individualized clinical care of n eurooncological patients.

Introduction  
As in the previous year, the author’s aim for the 
selection of the “top ten” paper series in the field of 
neurooncology was to select an equilibrated mix of 
high-quality manuscripts that provide new tumor  
biological concepts, new tumor entities, new diag-
nostic tools or approaches, and clinical studies with 
specific targeted approaches, all touching the field 
of neuropathology. This should not at all devalue  
excellent papers in the field of neurooncology with 
a different focus, such as neuroradiology, neuro-
physiology or neuropsychology, but rather focus on 
the central aims and scope of Free Neuropathology , 
namely morphological or molecular techniques 
based on bio specimens such as tissues, cells of  
fluids. The search strategy for this year’s “neuroon-
cology update” series was similar as previously de-
scribed [Mittelbronn, 2023] . Whereas in 2022, a 
major focus was put on studies focusing on profiling, 
“omics” and new diagnostic applications, many 
more cutting -edge studies presenting new tumor  
biological mechanisms in the field of neurooncology 
were published in 2023. One point that negatively 
struck the author last year was the fact that despite 
the large amount of pro filing data, very few studies 
aimed at translati ng those findings into clinical  
applications. It is a central paradigm of our field that 
an excellent clinical treatment necessitates precise 
and fast diagnosis as well as identification of specific 
targets, allowing for the best individualized clinical 
care. It is gratifying to see the development and  
implementation of new treatment approaches to 
address molecular targets that have been intro-
duced in daily neuropathological routine over recent 
years. Although  this year’s series also presents some 
new tumor subtypes and further improvements in 
diagnostic procedures, a larger part focuses on 
novel, more basic tumor biological mechanisms, as 
well as very promising clinical studies that aim to 
treat brain tumors i n a more specific and individual-
ized manner to complement or even replace the 
classic neurooncological treatment triad of surgery, 
radio - and chemotherapy. With this, the “top ten” 
series in neurooncology for 2023 reads as follows:  1. Frequency -dependent MAPK  and NFkB path-
way-activation by rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations as 
potential treatment target in glioma [Hausmann 
et al., 2023] . 
2. GAP43 -dependent transfer of mitochondria 
from astrocytes to glioma cells increasing cellu-
lar proliferation and self -renewal [Watson et al., 
2023] . 
3. Brain endothelial cell remodeling by CNS meta-
static cell -derived matrix -metalloprotease 9 
(MMP9) as mechanism for extravasation  
[Karreman et al., 2023] . 
4. Microglia suppresses brain metastasis formation 
in breast cancer [Evans et al., 2023] . 
5. Proposal of a new tumor entity: Glioneuronal  
tumor with ATRX alteration, NTRK gene fusion 
and anaplastic features (GTAKA) [Bogumil et al., 
2023] . 
6. “De novo replication repair deficient glioblas-
toma, IDH wildtype”: a new glioblastoma sub-
type with implications for targeted treatment 
[Hadad et al., 2023] . 
7. Ultra -fast, machine -learning based intraopera-
tive methylation profiling [Vermeulen et al., 
2023] . 
8. Multiomics neuropathology improving diagnos-
tic precision, targeted therapy and detection of 
cancer predisposition syndromes in pediatric 
neurooncology [Sturm et al., 2023] . 
9. Clinical vaccination study targeting H3K27M in 
adult diffuse midline glioma [Grassl  et al., 2023] . 
10. Clinical study in patients with IDH mutant low -
grade glioma using an oral, brain -penetrant  
inhibitor of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes 
[Mellinghoff et al., 2023] . 
Interdisciplinary discussions are important as 
the key role of neuropathologica l shifts from being 
purely diagnostic to prognostic to more and more 
theranostic. An increased number of neurooncolog-
ical patients are currently treated based on  
biomarker -guided decisions jointly made in multidis-
ciplinary molecular tumor boards [Renovanz et al., 
2023] . As in many neurooncological centers the  
immunohistochemical, DNA/RNA in -situ, genetic Free Neuropathology 5: 21 (2024) Michel Mittelbronn

and/or epigenetic biomarker analyses are per-
formed by neuropathologists, it is imperative that 
neuropathologists help to rapidly translate unequiv-
ocal find ings from both basic tumor biological and 
clinico -oncological studies into diagnostic or 
theranostic tests to facilitate improved patient care.  
The author strongly hopes that the selected pa-
pers will both fascinate the readers and further stim-
ulate discuss ions around neurooncological topics in 
neuropathology.  
1. Frequency -dependent MAPK and 
NFkB pathway -activation by rhythmic 
Ca2+ oscillations as potential treat-
ment target in glioma [Hausmann  et 
al., 2023].  
It has been previous ly reported that glioma 
cells are not only interconnected between each 
other but also to neurons via microtubes enabling intercellular communication via calcium signaling 
[Venkataramani et al., 2019] . Calcium signaling  
induced by neuronal activity increase d the for-
mation of glioma microtubes and cell invasion  
[Venkataramani et al., 2022] . However, the exact 
mechanisms how the intercellular communication 
between neurons and glioma cells or uniquely 
amongst glioma cells were still not fully deciphered. 
In the  present study, Hausmann et al. showed that a 
minor glioma cell fraction, accounting for only 1 –5 % 
of all tumor cells is able to rhythmically trigger Ca2+ 
oscillations [Hausmann et al., 2023] . Those cells  
belong to the cellular fraction showing a considera-
bly higher number of tumor microtube connections 
to other glioma cells. As the Ca2+ oscillations in  
glioma cells were not only observed in vivo  in the 
presence of neurons but also in neuron -free cell  cul-
ture conditions, one can assume that this pe riodic 
activity is a glioma -cell autonomous mechanism.  
This hypothesis was further corroborated by the 
finding that blocking gap junction and/or tumor

microtube formation did not reduce the periodic 
Ca2+ activity in this small glioma subpopulation, but 
considerably reduced the related Ca2+ activity in the 
intertumoral network. A pharmacol ogical screen  
revealed that specific inhibition of the calcium -acti-
vated potassium channel KCa3.1 reduced Ca2+ activ-
ity also in those glioma cells. The respective potas-
sium channel appears to be of interest in glioma  
biology as implications for enhanced ma lignant  
behavior, in particular enhanced glioma cell invasion 
in the presence of KCa3.1, have been reported 
[D'Alessandro et al., 2013; Turner et al., 2014] . 
KCa3.1 -positive cells rhythmically stimulated Ca2+ 
signaling at a mean frequency of 12.5 –12.7 mHz  (in 
vivo) and 9.7 –11.3 mHz ( in vitro ) within the glioma 
network, apparently a range in which also the MAPK 
and NFkB pathways increase cell proliferation and 
survival. Along this line, the inhibition or knockout of 
KCa3.1 led to reduced MAPK and NFkB pathw ay 
activity while its stimulation enhanced the activity of 
both pathways. The knockdown of KCa3.1 was asso-
ciated with significantly reduced glioma growth in 
animal models and survival analyses of an openly  
accessible patient cohort (The Cancer Genome Atlas  
- TCGA) revealed that glioblastoma patients with 
high KCa3.1 expression showed significantly worse 
survival as compared to their counterpart with low 
KCa3.1 expression. In summary, those findings point 
to a new treatment option for glioblastoma patients 
by targeting more specifically KCa3.1 thereby focus-
ing on the cell population that seems to negatively 
orchestrate the glioma cell network. Although it was 
demonstrated that the cell state of rhythmically per-
forming Ca2+ signaling is hierarchical, but highl y plas-
tic, it still remains to be determined why only a very 
small subpopulation of glioma cells acquire this 
state at any given time (summary of the proposed 
mechanism in Figure 1) . 
2. GAP43 -dependent transfer of mito-
chondria from astrocytes to glioma 
cells increases cellular proliferation 
and self -renewal [Watson et al., 2023].  
It has previously been shown that brain cells  
interact via tunneling nanotubes (TNT), in neoplastic 
conditions also known as tumor microtubules (MTs), 
by which larger cellular orga nelles such as mitochon-
dria can be transferred. In particular, glioblastoma cell-derived mitochondria can be shuttled into non -
neoplastic astrocytes that subsequently adapted to 
tumor -like metabolism and hypoxia conditions  
[Valdebenito et al., 2021] . The s tudy of Watson et 
al. analyzed the reverse, namely how mitochondria 
are transported from residual non -neoplastic astro-
cytes to glioma cells and how this impacted glioma 
cell function [Watson et al., 2023] . To elucidate this 
question, the authors used diffe rent mouse and rat 
glioma models with mitochondria and glioma cells 
fluorescing in different colors. By doing so, they 
could demonstrate that between 15 to 60 % of  
glioma cells incorporated mitochondria of non -neo-
plastic astrocytic, and to a lesser extent also micro-
glial origin. It could further be shown that physical 
contact betwee n non -neoplastic astrocytes and  
glioma cells is necessary for mitochondrial transfer. 
Inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin B 
reduced the mitochondrial transfer rate , indicating 
an important role of actin cytoskeleton remodeling 
as an underlying mechanism. Hypothesizing that the 
actin -associated protein GAP43 that is involved in 
neurite outgrowth could be implicated in this mech-
anism, the authors knocked down GAP43 an d 
observed significantly reduced mitochondrial trans-
fer. Importantly, RNA sequencing showed an in-
crease of gene activity related to electron transport 
and mitochondrial organization therefore suggest-
ing a functional implication of mitochondrial trans-
fer. T his was corroborated by metabolic analyses 
showing a higher basal and maximal respiration rate 
in glioma cells having incorporated a higher number 
of astrocyte -derived mitochondria. This glioma frac-
tion was also more aerobic and energetic as com-
pared to th eir counterpart with lower mitochondria 
incorporation rate. In addition, amino acid and  
nucleotide metabolism were significantly altered in 
glioma cells with a higher transfer rate of mitochon-
dria indicating a metabolic reprogramming that 
might be importan t for pro -proliferative, antioxida-
tive and various cell signaling processes. The first ev-
idence that this mechanism might play an important 
clinical role in neurooncology was observed in a 
mouse glioma model in which animals with glioma 
cells that incorpor ated astrocyte -derived mitochon-
dria showed significantly shorter survival rates as 
compared to glioma cells without mitochondria 
transfer (summary of the proposed mechanism in 
Figure 2) . Free Neuropathology 5: 21 (2024) Michel Mittelbronn

3. Brain endothelial cell remodeling by 
CNS metastatic cell -derived matrix -
metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) as a mech-
anism for extravasation [Karreman et 
al., 2023].  
Brain metastases still constitute the most fre-
quent malign ant CNS tumors, being much more  
frequent than t heir primary CNS tumor counter-
parts. There is a broad agreement on the key steps 
of cancer cell extravasation from the bloodstream to 
the CNS similarly to leukocyte extravasation includ-
ing a) rolling/adhesion of cancer cells to brain endo-
thelia, b) alterat ion of the blood -brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability and c) trans -endothelial migration, 
however, the exact underlying mechanisms are still 
not fully understood [Alsabbagh et al., 2023] . Previ-
ous observations, that primary cancer cells are able 
to considerabl y change the structure of brain vessels 
[Haskó et al., 2019] , prompted the authors to deci -pher more precisely the potential underlying mech-
anism. By com bining fluorescent and electron  
microscopy on murine brain metastasis models, the 
authors were able to trace the moment of interac-
tion between cancer and endothelial cells and study 
those events at high resolution. The observed vascu-
lar arrest of cancer cells was mainly seen at vessel 
branch points where cancer cells acquired an elon-
gated shape and surround ing vessels a significantly 
dilated state with disorganized basement mem-
branes. Furthermore, the moment of extravasation 
could also be captured by showing tumor cell nuclei 
both partly inside and outside of brain capillaries 
with a nuclear diameter of less  than 1 µm. The most 
prominent disruption of the basement membranes 
was observed during the extravasation process of 
cancer cells, without surpassing the astrocytic or  
microglial cell layers. Brain capillaries affected by 
cancer cell extravasation showed t hree major,  
reproducible findings, namely a) the formation  
of neo -lumina parallel to the pre -existing ones,  
Free Neuropathology 5: 21 (2024) Michel Mittelbronn

Figure 3:  Alteration of brain endothelium upon interaction with MMP9 producing cancer cells.  
b) formation  of endothelial cell projections and c) 
obstruction of brain capillary lumina by swollen  
endothelial cells (Figure 3) . Of note, those changes 
were reversible within 4 days if cancer cells left the 
respective blood vessel without performing extrava-
sation. F urthermore, the faster cancer cells were 
able to extravasate, the more successful the survival 
rate of those cells was in the perivascular niche. 
Once cancer cells successfully extravasated and 
started perivascular metastatic growth, prominent 
endothelial cell remodeling led to the formation of 
capillary loops that followed  the localization of  
tumor cells. The formation of capillary loops was 
even a prerequisite for the formation of macrome-
tastases. This mechanism was mediated by cancer 
cell derived matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). 
Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of MMP9  
expression led to significantly reduced endothelial 
cell remodeling, extravasation of cancer cells, and 
the formation of metastases. These findings contrib-
ute to a better understanding  of brain metastasis 
formation and may pave the way for new prevention 
or treatment strategies.  4. Microglia suppress breast cancer 
brain metastasis formation [Evans et 
al., 2023].  
Multiple studies have suggested a detrimental  
role of microglia in the development and/or pro-
gression of brain metastases [Izraely S et al., 2023; 
Pukrop et al., 2010] . To overcome the issue of  
distinguishing the contribution of primary cerebral 
microglia from secondarily invaded cells of the mye-
loid lineage (most importantly macrophages), the  
authors chose a complex study design including  
single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) as well as  
genetic and humanized mouse models approaches 
[Evans et al., 2023] . In a murine breast carcinoma 
brain metastasis m odel in which intracardiac injec-
tion of tumor cells led to brain metastasis formation, 
scRNAseq revealed stable pro -inflammatory expres-
sion signatures related to cytokine production,  
antigen processing and presentation, and inter-
feron -beta responses. As th is signature was micro-
glia-specific and only encountered upon brain

metastasis formation, the authors hypothesized 
that these transcriptional changes were related to 
tumor cell sensing and pathological tissue altera-
tions. An experimental depletion of microglial cells 
using a genetic model with d eletion of a key super -
enhancer in the Csf1r  locus was associated with  
enhanced metastasis formation and reduced sur-
vival rates. Mechanistically, the authors showed that 
in the context of brain metastasis formation, micro-
glial cells activate NK/NKT and CD8+ T cells, while  
attracting relatively less immunosuppressive T regu-
latory cells. Of note, experimental depletion of  
effector T cells led to reduced antigen presentation 
and IFN response in microglial cells, suggesting that 
only the orchestrated interaction between both  
cell types enables their full antitumoral capacity 
(Figure 4) . The antitumoral responses were con-
served in an additional experimental mouse model 
with human microglial cells. The authors reanalyzed 
data from an RNA sequencing study  from human 
breast cancer brain metastasis patients [Varešlija et 
al., 2019] . In line with their findings and hypotheses, this patient cohort demonstrated significantly 
longer survival rates if breast cancer brain metasta-
ses were associated with a high exp ression of canon-
ical microglial markers indicating a higher tumor  
infiltration by microglial cells. Although still many 
scientific papers stress a pro -tumorigenic role of  
microglial cells in primary and secondary brain  
tumors, the findings of the present s tudy are also in 
line with some human tissue -based studies describ-
ing a beneficial contribution of microglial cells to 
prolonged patient survival in glioblastoma [Zeiner et 
al., 2019] . 
5. Proposal of a new tumor entity: Glio-
neuronal tumor with ATRX alterat ion, 
NTRK gene fusion and anaplastic fea-
tures (GTAKA) [Bogumil et al., 2023].  
Although glioneuronal neoplasms constitute a 
fairly rare group of brain tumors, new entities  
belonging to this group are constantly emerging, 
Free Neuropathology 5: 21 (2024) Michel Mittelbronn  
doi: https://doi.org/10.17879/freeneuropathology -2024 -5809  page 8 of 16 
 
 
 
mainly due to the increasing use of molecular meth-
ods and respective analyses in larger, centralized  
databases that allow for a faster collection of iso-
lated rare cases. DNA methylation profiling revealed 
a distinct new group of 20 cases (median age: 19 
years) of mainly supratentorial (84 %)  location with 
histologically glioneuronal features as compared to 
a reference cohort of more than 100,000 patients. In 
a more fine -tuned approach comparing those cases 
with a reference cohort of 718 neuroepithelial  
tumors, unsupervised, non -linear t -distr ibuted sto-
chastic neighbor embedding (t -SNE) projection, this 
distinct subgroup could be confirmed. Further de-
tailed neuropathological and molecular pathological 
analyses could be performed in 16 out of those 20 
tumors. All tumors showed alterations of ATRX, 
assessed by DNA sequencing and/or immunohisto-
chemistry. In addition, all cases showed a potentially druggable gene fusion involving members of the  
receptor tyrosine -kinase family, mainly NTRK1 -3. In 
slightly more than half of the patients, homozygous 
deletion of CDKN2A/B  was observed. The neuropa-
thological assessment of those tumors showed iso-
morphic, round, often condensed nuclei with peri-
nuclear clearing, prominent mitotic indices and vas-
cular proliferations. For this new entity, the pro-
posed acronym “ GTAKA” is composed of its central 
neuropathological and molecular features, namely 
Glioneuronal Tumor with ATRX alteration, Kinase  
fusion and Anaplastic features (Table 1) . At the  
current stage, it is too early to provide precise prog-
nostic estimations, however this new subgroup of 
glioneuronal tumors with a median progression -free 
survival of only 12.5 months seems to be clearly 
more aggressive than many other, already estab-
lished glioneuronal tumor entities.

6. “De novo replication repair deficient 
glioblastoma, IDH wildtype”: a new 
glioblastoma subtype  with implica-
tions for targeted treatment [Hadad et 
al., 2023].  
Over decades, the treatment of glioblastoma 
patients consisted of neurosurgical resection fol-
lowed by radio -chemotherapy and is, however, still 
associated with a detrimental prognosis. Despite  a 
multitude of clinical studies, valid biomarkers for  
potential targeted therapies are largely lacking 
[Rodgers et al., 2024] . Therefore, it is highly im-
portant to define glioblastoma subtypes, even if 
they only occur at low percentages, that might ben-
efit from new treatment approaches. In a recent 
larger series of 459 consecutive glioblastoma  
patients, 9 patients (2 %) with a biallelic inactivation 
of a canonical mismatch repair gene (MSH2, MSH6 
or MLH1) were identified, partly with a heterozy-
gous germlin e mutation (indicating an underlying 
Lynch syndrome) in a part of the glioblastoma  
patients [Hadad et al., 2023] . While overall muta-
tion rate was significantly increased in this tumor 
group, they showed lower rates of classic genetic  
glioblastoma alterations such as trisomy of chromo-
some 7, monosomy of chromosome 10, TERT pro-
moter mutation, EGFR amplification or homozygous CDKN2A deletion. In 3 out of those 9 patients, addi-
tional mutations in the proofreading domain of the 
DNA polymera se POLE  were detected being associ-
ated with an ultrahypermutational state of more 
than 100 mutations per megabase. Of note, the  
mismatch repair deficient (MRD) glioblastomas pre-
sented as a giant cell variant of glioblastoma and 
DNA methylation profile eith er matched with  
“diffuse pediatric -type HGG, RTK1 subtype, subclass 
A”, “adult -type diffuse HGG, IDH -wt, subtype E” or 
did not match at all. Clinically, the median age at  
 tumor occurrence was significantly lower (50 years) 
in the MRD group as compared to non-MRD glioblas-
toma patients (63 years). In addition, median overall 
survival was more than twice as long (36.8 months) 
in MRD glioblastoma as compared to non -MRD  
patients (15.5 months). Microscopically, MRD glio-
blastoma were associated with significantly  more 
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and microglia cells indicating a 
stronger immune activation in the context of a  
hypermutational state. As smaller studies demon-
strated that some MRD glioblastoma patients radio-
logically and clinically profited from immune check-
point inhibition treatment, the identification of such 
patients (Table 2)  is important [Bouffet et al., 2016] . 
With this, a better clinical patient stratification  
regarding improved survival times and suitability for 
treatments with immune checkpoint inhib itors is 
possible.

7. Ultra -fast, machine -learning based 
intraoperat ive methylation profiling 
[Vermeulen et al., 2023].  
Methylation profiling considerably improved 
the unbiased and precise classification of brain  
tumors and was rapidly acknowledged as an essen-
tial criterium for diagnostics of most brain tumor  
entities by t he WHO guidelines [Capper et al., 2018; 
WHO classification of brain tumors, 2021] . Most  
institutions performing methylation profiling still 
use an array -based approach for which the entire  
laboratory process before bioinformatic analyses 
takes approximately one week. However, for the  
intraoperative surgical guidance and potentially  
upcoming new treatment approaches with applica-
tion of substances or cells directly in the tumor  
 cavity, it might be important to have a precise, rapid 
on-site diagno sis. As brain tumors are more and 
more stratified according to molecular classes, an  
 intraoperative histological assessment for primary 
cerebral neoplasms is of limited interest in many 
such cases. To overcome those obstacles, a fast  
 genomic and epigenom ic assessment using  na-
nopore sequencing had been previously developed 
[Euskirchen et al., 2017] . The authors of the current 
study applied nanopore sequencing in combination 
with a neural network analysis (named “Sturgeon”) 
to molecularly classify CNS tumor s intraoperatively 
[Vermeulen et al., 2023] . In 45 out of 50 samples,  
an accurate diagnosis was already obtained 40 min 
after initiation of the sequencing procedure in a  
retrospective cohort. After this highly promising 
proof of concept results, the author s were able to 
achieve intraoperative molecular diagnoses within a 
turnaround time of 90 min. A major advantage of 
the Sturgeon model is that it can be universally  
used without retraining (see  https://g ithub.com/
marcpaga/sturgeon ) on several different flow cell 
types (e.g. MinION or PromethION using R9 and R10 
chemistry). However, the method is still strongly  
dependent on the tumor cell content. Therefore, a 
concomitant mirroring histological assessment  of 
the tissue assessed by the Sturgeon model could be 
beneficial.  8. Multiomics neuropathology improv-
ing diagnostic precision, targeted  
therapy and detection of cancer pre-
disposition syndromes in pediatric 
neurooncology [Sturm et al., 2023].  
Over the past decade, diagnostic improvement 
in neuropathology was strongly linked to constantly 
improved methylome profiling [https://www.mo-
lecularneuropathology.org/ mnp  based on Capper 
et al. 2018] . However, this approach has not yet con-
tributed significantly to improved treatment  
approaches, partially due to a lack of related prog-
nostic data or information about underlying genetic 
predisposition for tumor development that might be 
additionally important for further clinical follow -up 
[Farouk et al., 2021] . In their study, Sturm et al. 
combined methylation profiling with targeted panel 
sequencing in a cohort of more than 1,200 newly  
diagnosed pediatric brain tumors [Sturm et al., 
2023] . With this approach, they were able to 
achieve a refined diagnosis in almost every second 
case as c ompared to current WHO classification 
alone. Moreover, in almost every second case, a  
potential therapeutically relevant alteration was  
detected and 15 % of all tumors revealed a directly 
druggable genetic alteration with BRAF -V600E being 
the most frequent  (7.4 %), followed by FGFR1/3 
(4.0 %), ALK (0.8 %), NTRK2/3 (0.4 %), MET (0.1 %) 
and RET (0.1 %). For 10 % of all cases an underlying 
cancer predisposition syndrome was found, 
amongst those, most frequently neurofibromatosis 
type 1 (1.5 %), followed by TP5 3-related Li -Fraumeni 
syndrome (1.2 %), constitutional mismatch repair 
gene deficiency or Lynch syndrome including MLH1, 
MSH2 and MSH6 genes (1.1 %), ataxia -telangiectasia 
and ATM heterozygous carriers (0.9 %), neurofibro-
matosis type 2 (0.8 %), DICER syndr ome (0.6 %) and 
rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 1 related 
to SMARCB1 (0.4 %) were observed. Compared to 
the initial cohort [Capper et al., 2018] , 3 % of  
pediatric neurooncological cases in the present 
study belong to potentially new tumor classes.  
Of note, in up to one third of this pediatric patient  
cohort, discordant results were obtained when  
comparing standard WHO - and methylation -based 
analyses, particularly for the children histologi - 
cally displaying tumors with characteristics of a  Free Neuropathology 5: 21 (2024) Michel Mittelbronn

Table 3 : Molecular risk stratification classes for of pediatric high -grade gliomas otherwise classified according to CNS WHO grade 3 –4. The 
molecular risk remains unknown for cases revealing high score for non -neoplastic control tissue or being unclassifiable in the DNA meth-

high -grade  glioma. Taken into account that clinical 
follow -up revealed that molecular profiling provides 
a better clinical prediction for patient prognosis than 
morphological assessment, it was highly recom-
mended to implement multiomics neuropathologi-
cal assessment in the diagnostic routine. The  
present study still highlights the importance of 
methylation profiling, as methylation data being  
discordant to the initial neuropathological diagnosis 
was considered as relevant in up to 70 % of the cases 
discussed in interd isciplinary tumor boards. A very 
useful tool of the study is the proposed molecular 
risk stratification of pediatric high -grade gliomas 
that have been classified according to CNS WHO 
grade 3 –4 (Table 3) . Although the WHO classifica-
tion would put such tumors in a very similar biologi-
cal class, it has to be taken into account that their 
clinical behavior might be very different and that multiomics, in particular methylation profiling, pro-
vides a much more precise prediction in those cases. 
Of note, the highly successful results of the present 
study further had a strong impact on health politics. 
German national health insurances now provide  
financing for DNA methylation profiling and gene 
panel sequencing ( for the latter in both tumor and 
blood leukocyte samples) in parallel for every newly 
diagnosed brain tumor case in children and adoles-
cents, thereby changing the standard -of-care.  
9. Clinical vaccination study targeting 
H3K27M in adult diffuse midline  
glioma [Grassl et al., 2023].  
While mutations in histone H3 have been de-
tected in several human tumors, the H3K27M muta-
tion in diffuse gliomas of mainly younger patients

constitutes a specific brain tumor entity usually 
showing a detrimental clinical prognosi s [WHO  
classification of brain tumors, 2021] . Although, 
H3K27M mutant diffuse midline gliomas are incura-
ble, the first promising results were obtained from 
MHC -humanized mice showing a mutation specific 
immune response to a H3K27M long peptide vaccine 
[Och s et al., 2017] . This prompted the authors to 
start a phase I clinical trial with 8 patients suffering 
from a H3K27M -positive diffuse midline glioma 
[Grassl et al., 2023] . All patients received a 27 -mer 
peptide (p14 -40) including the mutant H3K27M  
via bi -weekly subcutaneous injection over 6 weeks 
followed by monthly administration for 4 months 
and quarterly afterwards until disease progression. 
The vaccine was well tolerated and without any  
relevant higher -grade side effects. After 2 injections, 
H3K27M -vacc ine related neoepitope -specific  im-
mune responses (in blood and CSF) were detected  in 
5 out of 8 patients and were associated with prom-
ising neuroradiological findings showing  reduced  
axial contrast enhancement. For patients from 
which previous tumor materi al was accessible, a  
colocalization of mutant H3K27M and HLA class -II-
DR was detected, indicating that the neoepitope is 
probably presented by antigen -presenting cells 
which might lead to a stimulation of H3K27M -spe-
cific T cells. Of note, the two patients of this phase I 
study with the best clinical outcome after detection 
of peripheral immune response also showed highest 
numbers of HLA class -II-DR-positive cells associated 
with mutant H3K27M which may indicate that  
enhanced immune cell responses associated  with 
mutant neoepitope presentation are responsible for 
better patient prognosis. With this first human  
vaccination trial for H3K27M mutant diffuse midline 
glioma, the authors demonstrated patient safety 
and neoepitope immune responses. As a most 
promisin g finding, complete remission for more 
than 31 months was achieved in one patient.  
However, all other patients died within the study  
period. To further improve the H3K27M vaccine -
based effects, the authors propose to administer the 
vaccine concomitantly wi th first line treatment to  
increase the time for T cell mediated antitumoral  
effects.  10. Clinical study in patients with IDH 
mutant low -grade glioma using an 
oral, brain -penetrant inhibitor of  
mutant IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes  
[Mellinghoff et al., 2023].  
In 20 09, the detection of specific point  
mutations in IDH1  and IDH2  genes in distinct brain 
tumor entities, in particular diffuse astrocytoma and 
oligodendroglioma, considerably changed the  
neuropathological diagnostic approach paving the 
way from a mainly histological to a more and more 
molecular classification [Yan et al., 2009] . The most 
frequently altered amino acid is 132 in IDH1  and 
172 in IDH2 . Thus, those alterations make them a 
promi sing treatment target. The application of the 
dual IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitor Vorasidenib in an  
 orthotopic murine glioma model showed consider-
ably reduced 2 -hydroxyglutarate levels that acts  
as an oncometabolite [Konteatis et al., 2020] . In 
addition, it was demonstrated that Vorasidenib also 
penetrated the brain of several non -human species 
therefore showing its CNS bioavailability in preclini-
cal models. This prompted several neurooncological 
teams to test IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors in the clinical 
context of which  the double -blind, phase 3 trial  
of Mellinghoff and colleagues is one of the most  
advanced studies for residual or recurrent CNS WHO 
grade 2 glioma comprising 331 patients in total 
[Mellinghoff et al., 2023] . The patients orally  
received Vorasidenib or pla cebo daily until disease 
progression or toxic treatment side effects occurred. 
Vorasidenib treatment was mainly associated with 
low-grade toxic side effects; however grade 3 or 
higher side effects were observed in 22.8 % of the 
patients in the Vorasidenib as compared to 13.5 %  
in the placebo control group. Of note, only 1.8 %  
of the patients treated with Vorasidenib showed  
serious side effects, therefore showing a clinically 
acceptable safety profile. The median progression -
free survival was significantly i mproved upon 
Vorasidenib treatment, reaching 27.7 months  
compared to only 11.1 months in the placebo  
control group. Furthermore, time to next follow -up 
treatment was significantly longer in the 
Vorasidenib treated patients for which the median 
had not been  reached by the time of publication of 
the study while the placebo group reached the  Free Neuropathology 5: 21 (2024) Michel Mittelbronn

median at 17.8 months. This study is another mile-
stone on the way to more specific, efficacious and 
safe brain tumor treatments. The US Food and Drug 
Administration has no w approved Vorasidenib as a 
systemic therapy for patients with Grade 2 astrocy-
toma or oligodendroglioma with a susceptible IDH1 
or IDH2 mutation, based largely on the result of this 
study (see https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources -
information -approved -drugs/fda -approves -vorasid

Discussion  
In 2023, several novel pathogenic mechanisms 
were published that might serve as potential targets 
for oncological treatment approaches in the future. 
However, it still remains to be determined if those 
mechanisms can b e targeted with high specificity 
without having negative side effects. For example, 
spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations are key in the  
modulation of glioneuronal synaptic information 
[Goenaga et al., 2023] . Therefore, it is unclear if 
rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations that activate frequency -
dependent MAPK and NFkB pathway in the context 
of brain tumors may be selectively targeted without 
negatively impacting the normal neurophysiological 
circuits [Hausmann et al., 2023] . To which degree  
a potential inhibi tion of GAP43 -dependent transfer 
of mitochondria from normal astrocytes to glioma 
cells may slow down tumor growth also in the  
human context has to be clarified [Watson et al., 
2023] . Although it seems obvious that fresh and 
healthy mitochondria transferre d to potentially  
exhausted glioma cells may serve as a powerhouse, 
a high metabolic plasticity has been reported for  
glioma cells allowing for sustainable tumor propaga-
tion via glycolytic energy production if mitochon-
drial -type energy supply is impaired [Shibao et al., 
2018] . This glioma cell feature may limit a treatment 
approach targeting the intercellular transfer of  
mitochondria between normal and neoplastic glial 
cells. The findings regarding the involvement of  
matrix -metalloprotease (MMP) in the proce ss of 
brain metastasis formation may serve as another 
promising therapeutic target in the prevention and 
treatment of brain metastasis, especially as several 
synthetic MMP inhibitors have been produced 
[Karreman et al., 2023] . Unfortunately, to date, many oncological trials applying MMP inhibitors 
failed because of either lack of efficacy or severe  
adverse side effects [Lopez -Navarro and Gutierrez, 
2022] . Finally, the tumor -suppressive effects of  
microglia cells demonstrated in the context of brain 
metastas is formation need a careful reassessment  
in humans as to date still many studies claim a  
promoting microglial effect for brain tumor for-
mation [Evans et al., 2023] . As previous studies  
in glioma have shown, the role of microglial cells  
in brain tumors is p robably less black and white and 
rather reflects a high cellular plasticity that is related 
to intratumoral microenvironmental changes result-
ing in both classic pro - and anti -tumoral features 
within the same tumor [Zeiner et al., 2019] . In 
summary, althoug h the aforementioned studies 
provide fascinating findings about brain tumor 
pathomechanisms, it seems to be too early to  
concretely judge the related diagnostic and, most 
importantly, therapeutic potential. In contrast, the 
diagnostic and prognostic potent ial for the pro-
posed new tumor entities seem to be clear. For the 
glioneuronal tumor with ATRX alteration, NTRK gene 
fusion and anaplastic features (GTAKA), the detri-
mental clinical course that is rather unusual for 
many glioneuronal tumors has to be stres sed 
[Bogumil et al., 2023] . As GTAKA could be unequiv-
ocally defined as a new class using methylation  
classification, its diagnosis also seems to be straight-
forward. The proposed new entity of “De novo  
replication repair deficient glioblastoma, IDH 
wildtype ” harbors a better prognosis as compared 
to other glioblastoma variants [Hadad et al., 2023] , 
and may also profit from checkpoint inhibitors. Both 
diagnosis and treatment rely on a neuropathological 
diagnostic approach requiring MMR and TMB test-
ing in diff use high -grade gliomas: a) presenting  
in patients with a younger median age (50 years)  
as compared to conventional glioblastoma,  
b) showing a giant cell morphology, and c) lacking 
classic methylation or mutational features usually 
observed in conventional glioblastoma (Table 2) . 
The diagnostics of such new entities should also  
be taken into account when developing new diag-
nostic tools. The ultra -fast, machine -learning based 
intraoperative methylation profiling can be applied 
without retraining but it is sti ll based on methylation 
data that has been published a few years ago  
[Vermeulen et al., 2023] . It is therefore essential Free Neuropathology 5: 21 (2024) Michel Mittelbronn

that the neuropathological community aligns on 
joint diagnostic standards, techniques and platforms 
so that molecular profiling can ach ieve similar  
results world -wide. This is even more important if 
different layers of omics approaches are combined 
[Sturm et al., 2023] . Over the recent years, neuro-
pathology was always at the forefront regarding 
technical development (e.g. methylation prof iling) 
and diagnostic precision in oncology (e.g. entity  
specific mutations such as IDH1/IDH2, H3K27M, 
ATRX only to name a few), subsequently also  
impacting other oncological domains. These devel-
opments prompted an extremely rapid clinical trans-
lation focu sing on specific drug targets such as 
H3K27M, IDH1/IDH2 or MRD tumors [Hadad et al., 
2023; Grassl et al., 2023; Mellinghoff et al., 2023] . 
In conclusion, it is fascinating to see how fast the  
improvements in diagnostic neuropathology with 
the definition of  specific treatment targets reached 
the bedside. After having shown drug safety and  
initial clinical efficacy, larger clinical trials are now 
necessary to define best treatment schemes.  Acknowledgements
