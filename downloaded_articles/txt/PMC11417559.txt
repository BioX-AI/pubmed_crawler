Diffuse gliomas in adults are highly infiltrative and largely incurable. Whole exome sequencing 
(WES) has been demonstrated very useful in genetic analysis. Here WES was performed to 
characterize genomic landscape of adult-type diffuse gliomas to discover the diagnostic, thera -
peutic and prognostic biomarkers. Somatic and germline variants of 66 patients with adult-type 
diffuse gliomas were detected by WES based on the next-generation sequencing. TCGA and CGGA 
datasets were included to analyze the integrated diagnosis and prognosis. Among 66 patients, the 
diagnosis of 9 cases was changed, in which 8 cases of astrocytoma were corrected into IDH- 
wildtype glioblastoma (GBM), and 1 oligodendroglioma without 1p/19q co-deletion into astro-
cytoma. The distribution of mutations including ATRX/TP53 differed in three cohorts. The ge-
netic mutations in GBM mainly concentrated on the cell cycle, PI3K and RTK pathways. The 
mutational landscape of astrocytoma was more similar to that of GBM, with the highest frequency 
in germline variants. Patients with IDH-mutant astrocytoma harboring SNVs of PIK3CA and 
PIK3R1 showed a significantly worse overall survival (OS) than wild-type patients. AEBP1 
amplification was associated with shorter OS in GBM. Our study suggests that clinical sequencing 
can recapitulate previous findings, which may provide a powerful approach to discover diag-
nostic, therapeutic and prognostic markers for precision medicine in adult-type diffuse gliomas.
1.Background
Gliomas are the most common brain malignancies, approximately accounting for 30 % of all primary brain tumors [1]. Due to the 
anatomic location in the brain, significant intratumoral heterogeneity, and fast developed therapy resistance, gliomas represent one of 
the most challenging malignancies [2]. The median survival time of glioma patients is 14–20 months even with standard of care 
therapeutics, which involves surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Gliomas are traditionally divided into histological grades I-IV. 
Recent advances in diagnostics and understanding of glioma molecular background have revolutionized its classification. Low grade 
glioma has been referred to grades I and II tumors while high grade glioma to grades III and IV. With advances in diagnostics and 
clinical experience, grade III IDH mutant gliomas are now considered lower grade gliomas in light of the patients ’ long survival time

Molecular biomarkers have been proposed to define central nervous system (CNS) tumor entities in addition to histopathology 
since 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of the CNS tumors [5]. Plentiful molecular parameters with clinico -
pathologic utility that play important roles in accurate diagnosis are also incorporated in 2021 WHO classification of the CNS tumors 
(CNS5) [6]. The diagnostic alterations not only offer a reference for targeted treatment, but also are important for prognostic 
assessment [7]. According to IDH1/2 and chromosome 1p/19q codeletion, adult-type diffuse gliomas are classified as IDH-mutant, 
1p/19q codeleted oligodendroglioma; IDH-mutant, non-codeleted astrocytoma and IDH-wildtype (WT) GBM [8]. The molecular 
features of IDH-mutant, 1p/19q codeleted oligodendroglioma include CIC, TERT p, FUBP1 , and NOTCH1 , among which CIC and FUBP1 
mutations are uncorrelated with overall survival (OS) in oligodendroglioma, while NOTCH1 mutations are significantly associated 
with worse OS [9]. ATRX and TP53 inactivating mutations occur frequently in IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and homozygous deletion of 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN2A/B ) is significantly associated with shorter OS [10]. The molecular characters of IDH-WT 
GBM are TERT p, gain of chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 (7/-10), and EGFR amplification [11]. In the WHO CNS5, the 
definition of tumor entities is emphasized using a few critical biomarkers except for morphology [12]. More alterations in key 
pathways still need to be identified to guide the patients appropriate for promising targeted therapies.
Whole exome sequencing (WES) based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proven remarkably useful in genetic analysis 
appropriate for both screening previously investigated and novel significant variants [13]. The mutational landscape of gliomas is 
complex [14]. Therefore, it is clinically necessary to acquire comprehensive genomic data using WES for exploring diagnostic, 
prognostic and predictive biomarkers [15]. In the current study, we utilized WES to characterize genomic landscape of 66 patients with 
adult-type gliomas to discover the mutational biomarkers for precise diagnosis and potential treatment options for adult-type gliomas.
2.Materials and methods
2.1. Sample and clinical data collection
The clinical data of 66 patients with adult-type diffuse gliomas were collected at Xiangya Hospital from January 2018 to December 
2021. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples obtained by surgical resection were used for integrated histological 
and molecular diagnosis. Collection and analysis of the samples were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Xiangya Hospital 
Central South University, and were in accordance with local regulations and principles of Helsinki Declaration. Written informed 
consent forms were obtained from all patients for research, without restriction. Meanwhile, 824 and 144 patients with primary adult- Abbreviations

2 type diffuse gliomas who had determined IDH and 1p/19q status were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and 
The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), respectively.
2.2. WES
For each patient, genomic DNA from FFPE and paired blood control samples was extracted using Qiagen DNAeasy kits (Qiagen, 
USA). DNA was eluted and stored at  20 •C for further use. The quantification of DNA was done using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life 
Technologies, USA). Fragment analysis was done with the Agilent Genomic DNA ScreenTape assay kit on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation 
system (Agilent Technologies, USA). KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPA Biosystems, USA) was used to prepare the sequencing libraries 
following the manufacturer ’s protocol. DNA was fragmented using enzymes, end prepped, ligated with adaptors and amplified. Hy-
bridization was performed with Agilent Technologies SureSelect Human All Exon version 5 (Agilent Technologies, USA). Quantity and 
quality of libraries was evaluated with Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Thermo Fisher, Cat. Q32854). Subsequently, the library size distribution 
was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies, USA). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina 
NovaSeq 6000 apparatus (Illumina Inc., USA) with paired-end sequencing. The mean target coverage was set at 300x for tumor 
samples and 100x for paired normal samples.
2.3. Bioinformatics workflow
Data quality was evaluated with FastQC (v0.11.9). Adapters and low-quality reads were removed using fastp (v0.20). Sequencing 
reads were mapped to the human refence genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA)-maximal exact matches algorithm, 
and default parameters were created to compress BAM files. The Genome Analysis Toolkit was used to realign the BAM files to improve 
the quality of alignment. Mutations including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and insertions and deletions (InDels) were tested via 
Vardict [16], and their biological functions were annotated by ANNOVAR [17]. Synonymous mutations were not included in the 
mutation analysis. Known germline SNVs with a population frequency greater than 0.015 in databases such as dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, 
and ESP6500 were excluded from the analysis. Copy number variants (CNVs) were identified using CNVkit [18].
2.4. Statistical analysis
The differences of mutational frequencies and clinical factors were calculated by the two-sided Fisher ’s exact test, and the odds 
ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was provided. Kaplan-Meier analysis based on log-rank test was executed to estimate 
survival curves, and the hazard ratio (HR) with 95 % CI was calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. P D0.05 was 
considered statistically significant for all hypothesis tests. All the statistical analyses and graphics were managed by computing 
software R v4.0.3.

3 3.Results
3.1. Patient characteristics
The clinical information of 66 patients with adult-type diffuse gliomas was summarized in Table 1. Male-to-female ratio was 1.75:1. 
The median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range: 25–69 years). Among 66 cases, 9 were diagnosed as oligodendroglioma, 22 as 
astrocytoma and 35 as GBM based on histopathology. According to the WHO CNS5, 8 cases were diagnosed as IDH-mutant, 1p/19q 
codeleted oligodendroglioma, 15 as IDH-mutant astrocytoma, and 43 as IDH-WT GBM (Fig. 1). Notably, due to assessment of IDH 
status, diagnoses of 9 IDH-WT patients were changed to GBM. In contrast, the diagnosis of one patient harboring IDH1 R132H was 
changed to astrocytoma. In addition, one case without 1p/19q codeletion was reconsidered as astrocytoma (Fig. S1A-C ).
According to the molecular features including IDH and 1p/19q status, oligoastrocytoma was divided into oligodendroglioma, 
astrocytoma and GBM. As shown in Table 1, the proportion of patients with oligodendroglioma in CGGA and TCGA database was 
relatively higher. Additionally, lower-grade gliomas evaluated by histology with high-risk markers were corrected as GBM in three 
cohorts.
3.2. Mutational prevalence across glioma subtypes
High-frequency SNVs in adult-type diffuse glioma were depicted in Fig. 2. TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene, followed by 
TERT , IDH1 , ATRX , NF1, PTEN , TTN, EGFR , RYR2 and CIC (Fig. 2A). TERTp was identified in three subtypes, more common in oli-
godendroglioma (7/8) and GBM (14/43). SNVs in TTN and RYR2 were also found in all subtypes and cohorts. EGFR and CIC SNVs were 
mainly detected in GBM and oligodendroglioma (Fig. 2B). ATRX and TP53 mutations were the molecular features of astrocytoma, but 
their VAFs were insignificant between astrocytoma and GBM (Fig. 2C–D). The mutational burden of high-grade IDH wild-type glioma 
was significantly higher than that of low-grade IDH wild-type glioma (p 0.022, Fig. S2).
3.3. SNVs, InDels and CNVs in driver genes
Multiple alterations occurred in driver genes EGFR , MET, PTEN , CDKN2A and CDKN2B . Three patients with GBM harbored both 
EGFR amplification and SNV, and two patients with astrocytoma harbored MET SNV and gain (Fig. 3A). Unlike R132 as the pre-
dominant variant of IDH1 in astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, the alterations in EGFR distributed evenly. However, more muta -
tions were in the extracellular domain of EGFR rather than the tyrosine kinase domain. Rare IDH1 R132 L/G and E240Q were also 
found in astrocytoma (Fig. 3B). Additionally, TP53 and ATRX somatic mutations were also located in the genes, but R273 was rela-
tively high in TP53 (Fig. S3A, B). CDKN2A/CDKN2B homozygous co-deletion occurred in 13 out of 43 cases, but sometimes altered in 
one of them (Fig. 3C).

4 3.4. Mutational landscape of key glioma pathways
A list of driver genes was grouped into carcinogenic pathways in the 66 patients (Fig. 4). The alterations in GBM, relatively more 
malignant type, were distributed in each pathway including p53/RB, DDR, RTK, PI3K, and RAS/MAPK, among which mutations in 
RTK, PI3K and RAS pathways were most common. Astrocytoma had a more similar mutational landscape to GBM than oligoden -
droglioma, with numerous mutations in cell cycle and RTK pathways. TERTp, CIC, NOTCH1 and MYC alterations were the charac -
teristic markers of oligodendroglioma (Fig. 4).
3.5. Germline variants in DDR pathway
Most germline variants occurred in the genes associated with DDR in cancer. DDR pathway contained multiple repair mechanisms 
including Fanconi anaemia (FA), homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NEJM), base excision repair (BER), 
direct repair (DR), mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision (NER) and translesion synthesis (TLS). Almost all germline variants 
were heterozygous except MSH3 in a patient with GBM (Fig. 5A). SLX4, BRCA2, FANCI, RECQL4, MSH6 and POLD1 were the genes 
commonly with germline variants. Three mutations in BRCA2 including S973L, G2508S and M3234V were evaluated as uncertain 
significance by InterVar (Fig. S3C). Unlike the somatic variants, germline variants occurred most frequently in oligodendroglioma than 
GBM and astrocytoma (Fig. 5B). The number of mutations in HRR and FA were all high in three subtypes (Fig. 5C).

6 3.6. Evaluation of treatment evidence
The genomic aberrations including somatic and germline variants in DDR pathway of adult-type diffuse gliomas were annotated 
based on the clinical actionability from OncoKB database. There were four therapeutic levels, including FDA-approved drugs, standard 
care, clinical evidence and biological evidence. Although GBM had 32.6 % of unknown selection, 9.3 % showed the treatment option at 
level 1 (Fig. 6A and B). High recommendations were from BRAF, ATM, EGFR (Fig. 6C). The level 3 for astrocytoma and oligoden -
droglioma was IDH1 inhibitor (Fig. 6C). These actionable molecular targets offered promising options for patients with adult-type 
diffuse gliomas in further treatment.
3.7. Prognostic biomarkers for IDH-mutant, non-codeleted astrocytoma
IDH was the prognostic marker for all adult-type gliomas. The mutations in key pathways were evaluated for their correlations with 
prognosis in the three subtypes. PI3K alterations were frequent in GBM, which provided additional treatment options (Fig. 6C). 
However, PIK3CA-PIK3R1 mutations were not significant predictive markers for prognosis in GBM. Patients with astrocytoma 
harboring PIK3CA-PIK3R1 SNVs had a significantly worse OS in both TCGA and CGGA databases (Fig. 7A and B). Due to the number of 
missing data of CNVs in CGGA, KM analysis of CDKN2A/B deletion and PI3K SNVs was only performed in TCGA. The patients

Heliyon  10 (2024)  e37712  
7 harboring both CDKN2A/B deletion and PIK3CA -PIK3R1 showed the worst OS (Fig. 7C). TERT p and chr 7/-10 in CGGA, PIK3CA - 
PIK3R1 , EGFR amplification, chr 7/-10, age, gender and MGMT promoter methylation status from TCGA cohort were calculated by 
multivariate Cox regression. The result suggested CDKN2A/B deletion (p 0.001, HR 4.05, 95 % CI 1.72 –9.52) and PIK3CA -PIK3R1 
(p 0.003, HR 6.1, 95 % CI 1.88 –19.86) were the independent prognostic markers of astrocytoma (Table 2). AEBP1 amplification 
was significantly associated with worse OS in our GBM cohort (p 0.031) (Fig. 7D) and tended to have a relatively shorter survival (p 
0.068) in TCGA cohort (Fig. S4).
4.Discussion
The WHO classification of brain tumors may be further modified with the presence of novel molecular findings. In such a trend of 
integrated histological and molecular diagnosis in CNS tumors, it is necessary to investigate the effective parameters based on an 
appropriate detection method. WES is a powerful tool to discover molecular diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers [13]. In this study, 
WES was used to analyze the genomic profiling of 66 patients with adult-type diffuse glioma. According to the mutational information, 
9 cases changed the diagnosis, precise treatment options were provided and PIK3CA -PIK3R1 SNVs were identified as a prognostic 
marker of astrocytoma.
Clinically, various methods have been used to test the mutational status. For example, immunohistochemistry is used to detect the 
specific antibodies of mutations including IDH1 R132H, H3 K27M and BRAF V600E [19], Sanger sequencing is performed to identify 
the mutations in tumor DNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is administered to test the chromosome structural variants 
including chr 1p/19q and chr 7/-10 [20]. WES can integrate the multiple tests to perform a comprehensive genomic analysis for

8 patients with adult-type diffuse gliomas.
IDH status and 1p/19q co-deletion were used to classify oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma and GBM defined by histology [6]. As-
trocytoma or oligodendroglioma without IDH1/2 mutations was reclassified as IDH-WT, GBM. Therefore, more GBM patients were 
defined in all three cohorts. A case harboring 1p36/19q deletion, ATRX and TP53 mutations diagnosed as oligodendroglioma ac-
cording to histology was changed to astrocytoma. ATRX status was thought to have a higher diagnostic priority than 1p/19q 
co-deletion, 1p/19q co-deletion oligodendroglioma with ATRX absent would be considered as astrocytoma [12]. In addition, 
1p36/19q deletion identified by FISH was not equal to 1p/19q co-deletion, which was not detected by NGS. The differential diagnosis 
of astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma based on molecular parameters still need to be explored.
Our results demonstrated the high mutational frequencies of TP53 , ATRX , NF1, PTEN , TTN and EGFR and molecular features across 
three subtypes, which were consistent with previous studies [21–23]. TERT p in our cohort was detected using WES, which was 
different from TCGA and CGGA cohorts. Passenger mutations, such as TTN and RYR2 [21], were discovered frequently and their 
function in cancer might be identified including addition of tumor mutational burden. Moreover, we also identified relatively higher 
mutational frequencies of MUC16 , MUC17 and MUC19 in our cohort. MUC family mutations occurred commonly in cancer, MUC16 
tended to be a favorable prognostic factor due to high immune infiltration in H3 G34-mutant diffuse hemispheric glioma [24].
EGFR alterations in GBM included multiple patterns, such as SNVs, CNVs, and fusions [25]. The EGFR -targeted drugs mainly fell 
into two categories: tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) including 
cetuximab and nimotuzumab [26]. Currently, no TKIs have been approved for patients with GBM [27], and less mutations in EGFR and

wildtype patients in TCGA (A) and CGGA (B) databases; (C) Patients with astrocytoma harboring both PIK3CA -PIK3R 1 and CDKN2A/B deletion had 
the worst OS, while the OS of patients with double wildtype was best; (D) GBM patients with AEBP1 amplification revealed a shorter OS than 
wildtype patients in our cohort.

9 PDGFRA were located at the intracellular domain. Therefore, mAb targeted to the extracellular domain might be more promising. WES 
contributed to revising the diagnosis by detecting rare SNVs such as R132 L/G, E240Q of IDH1 . In our study, CDKN2A/CDKN2B 
homozygous co-deletion occurred in 13 out of 43 cases. There is a study suggesting that homozygous co-deletion of CDKN2A and 
CDKN2B frequently occurs in malignant gliomas [28].
In our study, GBM showed the highest mutational heterogeneity in the adult-type diffuse gliomas, with aberrations mainly 
converging on key pathways including cell cycle, RTK, PI3K, RAS and DDR. Different from oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma basically 
had less alterations than GBM in such pathways. Telomere maintenance was required in proliferation of glioma, thus TERT p was 
universal in GBM [29]. TERT p was also the molecular feature of oligodendroglioma, and showed significant mutual exclusivity with 
both TP53 and ATRX , which was a characteristic of astrocytoma. The VAF of ATRX was insignificant between astrocytoma and GBM, 
but astrocytoma tended to have a relatively high VAF of TP53 than GBM. Oligodendroglioma had the highest frequency of germline 
variants in DDR pathway, especially in NER, BER, HRR and FA. These molecular differences across three subtypes may provide some 
references for differential diagnosis and targeted intervention.
Compared with more complicated regulation pathways like cell cycle and PI3K, RTK and DDR pathways presented more actionable 
targeted markers. ATM mutations, germline and somatic variants of BRCA2 in HRR pathway could remind the patients of benefiting 
from PARPi [30,31]. RTK aberrations including EGFR and MET provided the options of TKIs with ability in blood-brain barrier for 
patients [32,33]. Currently, FDA has approved Tafinlar plus Mekinist for patients with solid tumors harboring BRAF V600E [34]. To 
some extent, it offers a new selection for the subsequent therapy of two patients with BRAF V600E in our cohort.
Regarding the prognostic factors of gliomas, IDH1/2 , 1p/19q codeletion, ATRX , BRAF were all confirmed to be the positive 
prognostic markers, while TERT p, chr 7/-10, EGFR amplification were all negative predictors [7]. In our study, patients with as-
trocytoma harboring PIK3CA or PIK3R1 mutation showed a significantly worse OS than those with WT in both TCGA and CGGA 
cohorts. Survival analysis suggested PIK3CA-PIK3R1 and heterozygous CDKN2A/B deletion were the independent prognostic factor of 
astrocytoma, which was proved by a previous study [12]. In cIMPACT-NOW Update 3, diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular 
features of GBM, TERT p, chr 7/-10 and EGFR amplification, was considered as WHO grade IV [11]. Aberrant PI3K signaling is 
associated with more than 80 % of GBM cases [35]. Therefore, PIK3CA -PIK3R1 mutations were also negative prognostic markers of 
diffuse astrocytic glioma. The follow-up of two astrocytoma cases with PI3K mutations in our cohort is in progress, and larger samples 
are needed to validate the hypothesis. AEBP1 could promote glioma cell proliferation and invasion, and its overexpression was 
correlated with short survival of GBM patients [36,37]. In our study, AEBP1 amplification was identified to be significantly associated 
with worse OS in GBM, suggesting that AEBP1 amplification might be a prognostic marker for GBM.
The current study may still benefit from a larger sample size for a more comprehensive research into mutations and SNVs of glioma 
and a more accurate survival analysis in glioma patients. Functional validations of the identified biomarkers and predicted drugs in the 
study need to be performed in larger cohorts for a practical realization of the manuscript.
5.Conclusions
We comprehensively characterized the mutational landscape of adult-type diffuse gliomas, and identified the differential diag-
nostic, therapeutic, and prognostic biomarkers for patients. This analysis may provide new insights into the genesis, classification, 
precise treatment and prognosis of glioma. In vivo validations of the identified biomarkers and evaluations of predicted drugs may 
prove valuable for future studies of precision medicine in glioma treatment.
