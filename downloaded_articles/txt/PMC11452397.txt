Brain tumor volumes as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) do not always spatially 
overlap with biological tumor volumes (BTV) measured by [18F]Fluoroethyltyrosine positron emission 
tomography ([18F]FET PET). We prospectively investigated volumetric patterns based on the extent 
of tumor volume overlap between the two modalities. Eighty-six patients with newly diagnosed 
glioma who had undergone MRI and [18F]FET PET between 2007 and 2009 were included in this 
prospective study and (re-)classified according to CNS WHO 2021 (Classification of Tumors of the 
Central Nervous System by the World Health Organization). Four different patterns of volume overlap 
were defined mathematically according to the extent of overlap between MRI-based T2 tumor 
volume (non-enhancing tumor volume, nCEV) and BTVs. Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) were determined. Seventy patients were diagnosed with isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype 
(IDHwt) glioblastoma and 16 with IDH-mutant glioma, respectively . The most common pattern was 
characterized by a larger non-contrast-enhancing tumor volume (nCEV) that enclosed all or most of the 
BTV and was observed in 46 patients (54%) (pattern 1). This pattern was more frequent in IDH-mutant 
gliomas than in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (81% versus 47%, p = 0.02). In multivariate analyses, 
pattern 1 was associated with prolonged PFS (HR 0.59; 95 CI 0.34-1.0; p = 0.05), but not OS (HR 0.66; 
95 CI 0.4–1.08; p = 0.1). For OS, presence of an IDH mutation ( p = 0.05) and lower age ( p = 0.03) were 
associated with prolonged OS. The spatial relation between nCEV and BTV varies within and between 
glioma entities. Most frequently, a larger nCEV encases the BTV. Some patients show spatially 
dissociated nCEVs and BTVs. Not accounting for this phenomenon in surgery or radiotherapy planning 
might lead to undertreatment.
Keywords Imaging, Positron emission tomography, Glioma, Glioblastoma, Radiotherapy
Gliomas are classified based on molecular and histological features as recommended by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor 
Taxonomy (cIMPACT)1–3. Overall, gliomas occur at an age-adjusted incidence rate of 4–6/100’000 population 
per year4. Standard therapy for adult gliomas comprises tumor resection if safely feasible, radiotherapy, alkylating 
agent chemotherapy and combinations thereof in high-grade and high-risk lower-grade gliomas5,6. Clinical 
decision making, radiotherapy planning and response assessment in affected patients rely on non-invasive 
imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to anatomic, MRI-based imaging, 
amino acid-based positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing O-(2-[18F]fluorethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET 
PET) provides valuable information on tissue vitality, metabolism and can be useful for prognostication7–11. 
Recommendations on clinical use of PET in gliomas, especially in the context of therapy response assessment, have 
been published by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology working group (RANO group)7. PET-derived

www.nature.com/scientificreportsbiological tumor volumes (BTVs) are often larger than contrast enhancing volume (CEV) portions in primarily 
enhancing tumors, but smaller than the non-enhancing volume (nCEV) portions9. However, morphological 
MRI-based tumor volumes might not always spatially overlap with BTV12. Comprehensive definition of a tumor 
volume, potentially incorporating different imaging modalities, is essential for therapy planning, especially 
for radiotherapy. Besides potential clinical implications regarding therapy planning, different volume patterns 
might inherently be associated with molecular markers or outcome. One methodological approach might be 
the definition of intersectional tumor volumes defining the pattern of overlap between MRI and PET volumes 
prior to any therapeutic intervention, e.g., nCEV enclosed in BTV or vice versa: These intersectional volumes 
have been shown to correlate with grading in anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas12. Intersectional tumor 
volume patterns could be investigated in an even more detailed fashion, e.g., as follows: nCEV larger that the 
BTV and enclosing all or most of it (I), or conversely a BTV larger than the nCEV and enclosing all or most of 
it (II), or similar volumes in both modalities with one overlapping the other (III), or lastly similar volumes that 
show minimal overlap, but large exclusive volumes (IV).
In this context, the aim of our study was to define different patterns mathematically and compare localization 
and extent of anatomic tumor volumes as assessed by MRI with [18F]FET PET-based BTVs in newly diagnosed 
glioma. We set out to investigate the patterns with regards to clinical and molecular parameters as well as 
progression-free and overall survival.
Materials and methods
Setting and patient inclusion criteria
Patients with newly diagnosed glioma between 2007 and 2009 who underwent histological sampling at the 
Department of Neurosurgery of the LMU University Hospital Munich and were eligible for MRI and [18F]
FET PET scans were included in this prospective study that was waived by our institutional ethics committee 
(NCT01089244; all experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine 
at LMU Munich; local project number: 325 − 11). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki and institutional guidelines as well as regulations. Informed written consent to participate in the 
study was obtained from all patients. Histopathological and molecular analyses were conducted at the Center for 
Neuropathology at the LMU University Hospital Munich. The CNS WHO 2021 classification was applied to all 
samples3. Informed consent was obtained from all patients during first inpatient treatment prior to first surgical 
procedure, i.e., frame-based stereotactic biopsy or surgical tumor resection. In case of stereotactic biopsy and 
in contrast-enhancing tumors, the enhancing foci were targeted according to a standardized protocoll13,14. 
If applicable, areas with increased 18F]FET PET-uptake were targeted. Last follow-up was December 2022. 
Reference points of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were set as the date of first surgical 
intervention to progression according to updated RANO criteria and date of death, respectively15,16. The datasets 
used and/or analysed during the current study available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
Imaging (MRI and [18F]FET PET)
Patients underwent MRI and [18F]FET PET scans within two weeks before invasive diagnostics by resection or 
biopsy. MRI and [18F]FET PET had to be obtained with 7 days difference or less. T1 sequences with and without 
contrast enhancement as well as T2 sequences were obtained in all patients. FLAIR sequences were not obtained 
in all patients and analysed if available. MRI scans were performed on 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla scanners (Philips Intera 
3T, Andover, MA and Signa HDxt, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Gadolinium-based contrast agent 
(Gadopentetatedimeglumin, Magnevist, Schering, Berlin, Germany) was applied intravenously at a dose of 0.1 
mmol/kg body weight. Tumor volumes in T2-weighted MRI scans was assessed through manual segmentation 
(HERMES Workstation, HERMES Medical Solutions, Stockholm, Sweden) by a faculty neurosurgeon 
specializing in glioma surgery. Furthermore, in cases where differentiation between edema and tumor tissue was 
difficult, the senior investigator (B.S.) was consulted and made the final decision. For differentiation between 
edema-related T2 alterations and putative nCEV , criteria described by Lasocki et al.  were used17. Accordingly, 
edema typically spares grey matter, e.g., cortex and nuclei, while nCEV potentially invades grey matter. Edema 
spreads concentrically along anatomical structures and respects their borders while nCEV inflates and distorts 
brain parenchyma, oftentimes eccentrically. The hyperintensity of edema might be more pronounced and fades 
towards the periphery, whereas nCEV is characterized by only mild T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. The mass effect of 
edema might be less pronounced and, if large in size, be generalized. In comparison, T2 hyperintensity caused 
by nCEV oftentimes presents with a focal mass effect and parenchyma expansion (Suppl. Table 1). Dynamic [18F]
FET PET scans were acquired utilizing Siemens ECAT EXACT HR + scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, 
Germany). Fasting for six hours prior to image acquisition was mandatory. Approximately 180 MBq of [18F]
FET PET was administered intravenously. Biological tumor volumes were measured by automated segmentation 
using a threshold for determination of [18F]FET PET-positivity of 1.6 tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR)10,18–21. The 
overlap between nCEV and BTV was determined by automated fusion of the two modalities after transferral to 
the HERMES workstation and using HERMES Hybrid Viewer 2.5.
Relative anatomical and biological tumor volumes
Based on the extent of overlap between nCEV and BTV , four different patterns were defined (Fig.  1). The term 
‘intersectional tumor volume’ is hereby defined as the overlapping volume between nCEV and BTV as assessed 
by [18F]FET PET. The proportion of intersectional tumor volume to nCEV was defined as ‘x’ . Conversely, the 
proportion of intersectional tumor volume to BTV was defined as ‘y’ .

Histopathology and molecular markers
Histological diagnosis was established at the Center for Neuropathology of the LMU University Hospital 
Munich according to the CNS WHO 2007 classification initially and retrospectively reevaluated in accordance 
with the CNS WHO 2021 classification22,23. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter 
methylation status was determined through methylation-specific PCR24,25. IDH mutational status was assessed 
using pyrosequencing of an 88-bp-long fragment for the IDH1  gene with codon 132 analysis and an 83-bp-long 
fragment for the IDH2  gene with codon 172 analysis. Microsatellite markers were used to detect allelic loss of 
chromosomes 1p and 19q.
Treatment
Treatment decisions were made based on interdisciplinary tumor board recommendations as well as in 
accordance with patients’ preferences. Tumor-specific therapy comprised surgical glioma resection if safely 
feasible, radiotherapy and alkylating agent chemotherapy26. Patients with glioblastoma were treated with 
radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol after histological sampling27.

Statistical analyses were performed utilizing SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and GraphPad PRISM 
9.4.1 (GraphPad software, inc., California, USA) software. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) were investigated through Kaplan-Meier estimator. For comparison of categorical, demographic data, 
chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact test were used if applicable. D’ Agostino-Pearson test was used to investigate 
normal distribution. Parametric data was compared by means of Student’s t-tests and ANOV A. Non-parametric 
data was compared by Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Uni- and multivariate analyses were 
performed through Cox proportional hazards regression models. Log-rank tests and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon 
tests, a test that gives more weight to deaths at early time points, were computed. Values for Gehan-Breslow-
Wilcoxon tests were only given in addition and were specifically outlined. The values given in the figures are 
based on Log-rank tests. P-values equal to or below 0.05 were termed significant.
Results
86 patients with newly diagnosed glioma between 2007 and 2009 were included in this study. All patients had 
undergone preoperative MRI and [18F]FET PET imaging. Median age at diagnosis was 60 years (range 25–79 
years) (Table  1). Diagnosis was IDHwt glioblastoma CNS WHO grade 4 in 70 patients (81%); IDH-mutant 
(IDHmut) astrocytoma CNS WHO grade 4 in 3 patients (4%), IDHmut astrocytoma CNS WHO grade 3 in 3 
patients (4%), IDHmut astrocytoma CNS WHO grade 2 in 4 patients (5%) and oligodendroglioma CNS WHO 
grade 2 with 1p/19q-codeletion in 6 patients (7%). Ten patients (12%) showed no contrast enhancement on 
initial MRI. MGMT promoter methylation was seen in 44 patients (51%). If safely feasible, tumor resection 
was conducted prior to radiation or chemotherapy. 50 patients (58%) received stereotactic brain biopsy and 36 
patients (42%) underwent tumor resection. Median follow-up time of surviving patients was 8.1 years, and only 
14 patients (16%) were alive at database closure. 10 of 14 patients alive at data base closure had a IDHmut glioma. 
Median follow-up of the surviving patients was 97 months.
Intersectional volume patterns and outcome
Pattern 1, i.e., a larger nCEV encasing all or most of the smaller BTV , was most prevalent among the entire 
cohort and seen in 46 patients (54%). Patterns 2, 3 and 4 were similarly distributed and detected in 12 (14%), 
15 (17%) and 13 (15%) patients respectively (Fig.  1). Within the glioblastoma cohort comprising 70 patients, 33 
patients (47%) displayed pattern 1. Patterns 2, 3 and 4 were seen in 12 (17%), 14 (20%) and 11 (16%) patients 
(Fig.  1). In patients with IDHmut gliomas, 13 (81%) were diagnosed with pattern 1. Patterns 2, 3 and 4 were 
seen in one patient per pattern (6%). Thus, pattern 1 was observed at a significantly higher rate in patients with 
IDHmut gliomas (patients with glioblastoma vs. patients with IDHmut glioma displaying pattern 1, 47% vs. 
81%, p = 0.02).
In the entire cohort, median PFS was 10.3 (range: 6.5–14.0) and median OS was 16.9 (range 8.3–25.6) months. 
PFS and OS were longest in patients displaying pattern 1 with 10.4 and 29.8 months (Fig.  2). Shortest OS and PFS 
were seen in patients with pattern 2 (PFS, in months, 5.0; OS, in months, 11.0) and pattern 4 (PFS, in months, 
5.5; OS, in months, 11.0) (Fig.  2). These patterns were both defined by larger portions of the BTV being spatially 
separated from the nCEV . Comparing pattern 1 ( n = 46) with pattern 2 and 4 ( n = 25), i.e., the two patterns with 
larger exclusive BTVs, PFS was significantly longer in patients displaying pattern 1 (PFS, in months; 10.4 versus 
5.3, p = 0.01) and there was a trend towards longer OS (OS, in months; 29.8 versus 11, p = 0.08) (Suppl. Fig. 1 ). 
When looking exclusively at the glioblastoma cohort, there was no significant difference between the cohorts for 
PFS ( p = 0.26) or OS ( p = 0.28) with Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, but the number of patients with patterns other 
than pattern 1 were low (Fig.  3). When performing Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test, survival was significantly 
longer in patients with pattern 1 ( p = 0.04).
Univariate and multivariate analysis
In the entire cohort, established molecular and clinical parameters such as age, methylated MGMT promoter, 
presence of an IDH mutation, lower CNS WHO grade and delay of therapy along with the intersectional volume 
pattern 1 were associated with a favorable PFS and OS times (Table  2). In the glioblastoma group, the outcome 
was comparable to the entire group (parameters such as CNS WHO grade, treatment and IDH status were not

multivariate analyses of the entire cohort, younger age was associated with longer progression-free and overall 
survival times. Pattern 1 was associated with prolonged PFS, but not OS. Presence of an IDH mutation was 
associated with longer OS (Table  3).
Discussion
Anatomic tumor volumes measured by MRI can differ from BTVs as assessed by amino- acid PET in patients 
with newly diagnosed glioma. Several studies have previously shown that BTV is usually larger than the CEV , 
but smaller than the nCEV in primarily contrast enhancing tumor entities7–9,12,28. Furthermore, besides mere 
differences in size, the overlap of the corresponding tumor volumes is often low12. This phenomenon and its 
clinical implications have not been investigated in detail yet. We aimed at defining different intersectional 
volume patterns and report highly variable intersectional volume patterns among gliomas and poor prognosis of 
patients with BTVs that were spatially dissociated from the nCEV .
In this study, 86 patients with newly diagnosed glioma CNS WHO grades 2–4 were assigned to four different 
groups according to the pre-interventional overlap pattern between nCEV (as defined by T2 tumor volume) 
and BTV (Table  1). We found heterogenous spatial distributions of nCEVs and BTVs both in patients with 
glioblastoma and patients with IDHmut glioma. Most patients (54%) showed a larger nCEV than BTV and 
enclosing all or most of the BTV , termed pattern 1 (Fig.  1). This group showed the best prognosis. Patterns 
characterized by larger BTV and small intersectional, i.e., spatially dissociated, tumor volumes showed shortest 
PFS and OS times (Fig.  2). In multivariate analyses, pattern 1 and younger age were associated with longer PFS, 
potentially hinting towards a therapeutic effect of targeting BTV and T2 tumor volume with regards to surgery 
and radiotherapy planning as opposed to a potential undertreatment of patients displaying other patterns.
Patients with IDHmut glioma displayed pattern 1 significantly more often than patients with glioblastoma 
(81% versus 47%). Patient- and glioma derived prognostic factors did not differ from findings reported in large,

combined (( A,B); p = 0.02 and p < 0.01). Pattern 1 was associated with longer OS than other patterns combined 
((D), p = 0.02). Pattern 1: non-enhancing tumor volume (nCEV) is larger than the biological tumor volume 
(BTV) and encloses all or most of it. Pattern 2: BTV is larger than nCEV and encloses all or most of it. Pattern 
3: nCEV and BTV are similar in size and there are minimal exclusive tumor volumes. Pattern 4: nCEV and 
BTV are similar in size, the exclusive tumor volumes are larger than the intersectional tumor volume.

age at diagnosis and IDHmut gliomas.
The relevance of nCEV for prognostication and therefore also treatment planning including resection and 
radiotherapy was recently unraveled in several studies. Especially in IDHmut malignant glioma, both resection 
as well as irradiation of the nCEV tumor portion have shown to be associated with improved outcome29–33. It 
has to be assumed that the nCEV harbors a significant portion of active tumor cells that might be responsible for 
a tumor recurrence28. This is in line with previous findings showing that glioblastoma recurrence often occurs 
within pre-irradiated parenchyma or close to the original tumor margin. While the incorporation of nCEV 
tumor part into irradiation planning might improve outcome, a too large resulting field of irradiation might be 
associated with a higher treatment related toxicity. In consequence, modulation of radiation treatment planning 
according to multiple imaging parameters, including PET derived BTV , might improve both tumor control and 
prolong tumor relapse34. In addition, BTV has been shown to harbor prognostic information and large pre-
therapeutic BTVs have already been reported to be associated with poor prognosis9. However, current treatment 
plans oftentimes neglect amino-acid PET-derived BTV , although not taking BTV into account when planning 
radiotherapy might be a risk factor for out of field recurrence. The clinical implication of targeting BTV to 
prevent undertreatment has not yet been determined prospectively. Efforts are currently made to investigate the 
role of BTV irradiation in recurrent glioblastoma in a clinical phase II trial (NCT01252459).
Another interesting question is whether the different tumor volume intersection patterns might represent 
differences in growth/invasiveness characteristics. Previous data suggested that different volume patterns might 
to be associated with grading: Arbizu et al. reported divergent volume patterns in CNS WHO grade 3 and 4 
gliomas12. Their data suggested a predominant pattern of BTV enclosed in larger MRI-volume in anaplastic 
astrocytomas while an opposite pattern was noted in glioblastoma. Our study did not investigate this hypothesis, 
however, our data show that different patterns can be found within one glioma entity. Further analyses are 
needed to investigate predominant, entity-specific intersectional volume patterns.
A limitation of this study might be a certain uncertainty concerning the delineation of nCEV as opposed to 
perifocal edema on T2/FLAIR-weighted images. Despite applying criteria by Lasocki et al. , certain differentiation 
is not yet possible on conventional imaging17. However, the inter-rater agreement for non-enhancing 
glioblastoma tissue on preoperative MRI is good and can be improved by relying on experts for tumor volume 
measurements35. This study is further limited by the low number of patients with IDHmut gliomas and the 
high probability of intercorrelation between variables. MGMT status, age and treatment were significant factors 
for outcome and all might be dependent on IDH mutational status. This renders multivariate analyses difficult 
to interpret. While BTVs were utilized for surgery planning in all patients and our center is a tertiary referral 
hospital, many patients received radiotherapy elsewhere and sufficient data on how often BTVs were utilized for 
radiotherapy target delineation could not be gathered. Accordingly, our data does not allow for a conclusion on 
the benefit of targeting BTV additionally. This question might be answered by the GLIAA-study (NCT01252459).
In summary, we report a high variability in intersectional volume patterns in glioma. Most frequently, 
the BTV is encased by the nCEV , but other patterns are not rare. Tumors that display a volume intersection 
pattern with considerable BTV portion outside the corresponding nCEV might show shorter progression-free 
survival. This might reflect a potential negative association between a mere MRI sequences-based surgery and 
radiotherapy target volume planning resulting in a possible undertreatment of metabolically active glioma 
tissue. Clinical trials evaluating inclusion of PET-derived volumes in treatment planning are urgently needed 
and in part already ongoing.
