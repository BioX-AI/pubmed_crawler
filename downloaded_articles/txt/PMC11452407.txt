Abstract
Introduction The methylation of the O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter is a valid biomarker for 
predicting response to therapy with alkylating agents and, independently, prognosis in IDH-wildtype(IDH-w) glioblastoma. 
We aim to study the impact of its methylation in overall survival of the unresectable IDH-w glioblastoma undergoing biopsy 
and systemic treatment.
Methods We collected six-year retrospective (2017–2023) data at a quaternary neurosurgery center for patients undergoing 
biopsy as the only surgical procedure for an unresectable IDH wildtype glioblastoma. Data was collected from patient records 
including neuro-oncology multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) documentation. Patients were grouped into categories 
according to different types of treatment received after biopsy (no treatment, chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), chemo-
radiotherapy (CRT), chemoradiotherapy with adjuvant temozolomide (CRT with adjuvant TMZ), EORTC-NCIC protocol 
followed by second line treatment) and according to methylation status (unmethylated (< 5%), borderline methylated (5–15%) 
and strongly methylated (> 15%)). Survival analysis was performed.
Results  166 glioblastoma IDH wildtype patients were included in the study with mean age of 62.5 years (M: F = 1.5: 1). 
70 (49.3%) patients had unmethylated MGMT status (< 5%), 29 (20.4%) patients had borderline methylated MGMT status 
(5–15%) and 43 (30.2%) patients had methylated MGMT status (> 15%). 36 (25.3%) patients did not receive any treatment 
post biopsy, 13 (9.1%) received CT only, 27 (19%) RT only, 12 (8.4%) CRT, 33 (23.2%) CRT with adjuvant TMZ, whereas 
21 (14.7%) received EORTC-NCIC protocol along with second line treatment.
In biopsy only group, there was no notable difference in survival outcomes among the different methylation statuses. For 
biopsy and any-other-form-of-treatment methylated groups showed a distinct trend of better survival compared to the bor -
derline or unmethylated groups. Overall, methylated patients had better survival as compared to unmethylated or borderline 
groups.
Conclusion Methylated MGMT status are predictors for better overall survival in unresectable IDH wildtype glioblastoma 
patients undergoing biopsy and treatment regardless of the treatment modality.

Introduction
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) pro-
moter methylation is shown to have survival benefit for glio-
blastoma patients undergoing maximal safe resection, radio-
therapy and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) followed by 
6 cycles of adjuvant TMZ, acting as prognostic marker [8 , 
12]. Furthermore, MGMT promoter methylation has now 
been shown to act as a predictive marker for response to 
TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. However, there is 
lack of level 1 evidence for impact of MGMT methylation  * Prajwal Ghimire

for inoperable glioblastoma undergoing biopsy and systemic 
treatment [2 , 3]. The systemic treatment options currently 
for inoperable glioblastoma undergoing biopsy only are 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, EORTC-NCIC protocol [12] 
and/or addition of second line chemotherapy depending on 
factors such as performance status, tolerance of treatment 
and other prognostic factors usually recommended through 
multidisciplinary team discussion (MDT) [2 , 3, 6].
The aim of our study is to understand the impact of 
MGMT methylation on inoperable IDH-wildtype glio-
blastoma patients who undergo biopsy and/or systematic 
treatment.
Materials and methods
MGMT-GBM is a retrospective single center study investi-
gating consecutive IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients who 
underwent biopsy at a quaternary neuro-oncology center. 
Neuro-oncology MDT and patient notes from digital hospi-
tal records were utilized to collect data from 2017 to 2023 
covering a period of six years.
Inclusion criteria
All adult patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma under -
going biopsy were included and clinical data along with 
MGMT methylation data were collected.
Exclusion criteria
Any patient who underwent subsequent resective surgery 
after the biopsy were excluded. Patients whose histological 
diagnosis were revised to grade 4 astrocytoma were excluded 
even if were given a glioblastoma diagnosis at the time of 
biopsy.
Patient categories
Patients were grouped into six treatment groups that 
included biopsy only without any subsequent systemic treat-
ment, chemotherapy only, radiotherapy only, chemoradio-
therapy, chemoradiotherapy with adjuvant temozolomide 
(TMZ) (EORTC-NCIC protocol), chemoradiotherapy with 
adjuvant TMZ and second line treatment such as lomustine, 
etoposide or PCV (procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine 
combination). These groups were further pooled by three 
methods:
1. EORTC-NCIC protocol: This method of pooling cat-
egorized the groups into 3: “no treatment”, “complete 
or incomplete EORTC-NCIC protocol” and “EORTC-
NCIC protocol with second line treatment”.2. Treatment: This method of pooling categorized the 
groups into 2: “No treatment” and “any treatment”. Any 
treatment included all the categories of systemic treat-
ment.
3. TMZ therapy: This method of pooling categorized the 
groups into 3: “Any TMZ therapy”, “only RT” and “No 
treatment”
MGMT methylation status categories
There were three categories for MGMT methylation [5 ]: 
MGMT 0: unmethylated (< 5%); MGMT 1: borderline meth-
ylated (5–15%) and MGMT 2: methylated (> 15%).
Data analysis
Data were analyzed with Chi-square test, one-way 
ANNOVA, Kaplan Meier survival analysis, log-rank test and 
cox proportional hazard model using Python and Microsoft 
Excel 2024. P  value of < 0.05 were considered to be statisti-
cally significant.
Results
One hundred and sixty-six patients were identified from the 
patient records for the study. Two patients were identified 
to have a revised diagnosis of high-grade astrocytoma and 
were excluded. Similarly, two patients went on to have a 
debulking surgery following the initial procedure of biopsy 
and thus were excluded. Twenty patients had missing data on 
systemic treatment as they were referred to other oncology 
centers for treatment. Therefore, 142 patients were available 
for analysis.  Patient demographics and clinical data are listed 
in Tables  1 and 2.
Methylation status
Unmethylated MGMT (MGMT 0) patients were 70 (49.3%) 
as compared to borderline methylated (MGMT 1) 29 
(20.42%) and strongly methylated patients (MGMT 2) being 
43 (30.28%) (Table  1). Further pooling the borderline and 
methylated patients led to two categories namely unmethyl-
ated (MGMT 0) and methylated (MGMT 1 + MGMT 2).
Treatment categories
Patients who underwent only biopsy without any other 
treatment were 36 (25.35%) whereas those who under -
went chemotherapy (CT) were 13 (9.15%); radiotherapy 
(RT) were 27 (19.01%); chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were 12 
(8.45%), chemotherapy ± radiotherapy and adjuvant temo-
zolomide (CRT + adjuvant RMZ) were 33 (23.24%) and Acta Neurochirurgica         (2024) 166:394

chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide along with 
second line treatment were 21 (14.79%) (Table  2).Overall survival analysis

and at 2 years of 0.06. The best treatment group with highest 
survival probability was the group who had strongly methyl-
ated MGMT status (MGMT 2) undergoing EORTC-NCIC 
protocol with second line therapy with survival probability 
at 1 year of 1.
Regardless of the MGMT status, the survival was longest 
in the group who underwent EORTC-NCIC protocol along 
with second line treatment and lowest in patient who did 
not receive any systemic treatment at all (Fig.  1). Regard-
less of treatment strategy, the survival probability at 1 year 
for unmethylated status (MGMT 0) was 0.18, for borderline 
MGMT methylation (MGMT 1) was 0.21 and for methyl-
ated MGMT status was 0.33 (Fig.  2). Furthermore, when 
the treatment groups were pooled together, the survival was 
better in any treatment group as compared to only biopsy 
with no treatment group of patients (p  = 0.005; test statis-
tic = 113.40) (Fig.  2).
In strongly methylated patients (“MGMT 2”), treatment 
with EORTC-NCIC protocol followed by second line ther -
apy had better survival outcome as compared to complete 
or incomplete EORTC-NCIC protocol (p  = 0.005; test sta-
tistic = 21.92). In borderline methylated patients (“MGMT 
1”), treatment with EORTC-NCIC protocol with second 
line therapy had better survival as compared to complete 
or incomplete EORTC-NCIC protocol (p  = 0.005; test sta-
tistic = 50.29) (Fig.  3). In patients with methylated MGMT 
(borderline or strong; “MGMT 1” + “MGMT 2”), statistical 
significance for longer overall survival was observed with 
patients undergoing EORTC-NCIC protocol with second 
line therapy as compared to patients undergoing complete 
or incomplete EORTC-NCIC protocol (p  = 0.0002) or 
patients undergoing biopsy only with no systemic therapy (p = 5.93e-08). Statistical significance was further observed 
for longer overall survival for patients undergoing complete 
or incomplete EORTC-NCIC protocol as compared to only 
biopsy with no systemic therapy (p  = 4.047e-09). In unmeth-
ylated patients (“MGMT 0”), treatment with EORTC-NCIC 
protocol with second line therapy had better survival as 
compared to complete or incomplete EORTC-NCIC proto-
col (p  = 0.005; test statistic = 84.67). Similarly, in unmeth-
ylated patients, EORTC-NCIC protocol provided patients 
with statistically significant survival benefit as compared to 
patients undergoing only biopsy with no systemic treatment 
(p = 6.838e-13). This was also true for patients receiving 
EORTC-NCIC protocol with second line treatment as com-
pared to patients undergoing only biopsy with no systemic 
therapy (p  = 1.686e-05) (Fig.  3).
Statistically significant longer overall survival was 
observed in methylated tumor patients who underwent any 
form of systemic treatment namely complete/incomplete 
EORTC-NCIC protocol and EORTC-NCIC protocol with 
second line treatment (p  = 0.005; test statistic = 37.47) as 
compared to no treatment category along with longer sur -
vival tails (Fig.  3). In biopsy only group with no treatment, 
there was no notable difference in survival outcomes among 
the different methylated statuses (Fig.  3).
On TMZ therapy pooling, unmethylated (“MGMT 
0”) group showed significant differences in survival 
between all treatment comparisons (any TMZ therapy, 
only RT and no treatment)( Any TMZ therapy vs. No 
treatment: p = 8.11e-12; Any TMZ therapy vs. Only RT: 
p-value = 0.01; No treatment vs. Only RT: p -value = 3.72e-
07). Similarly, moderately methylated (“MGMT 1”) 
group showed significant differences between “Any

was observed when complete or incomplete EORTC-NCIC protocols were pooled together. (KM: Kaplan Meier, EORTC-NCIC protocol:

TMZ therapy” and both “No treatment” and “Only RT”( 
Any TMZ therapy vs. No treatment: p  = 4.78e-05; Any 
TMZ therapy vs. Only RT: p  = 0.002). There was no sig-
nificant difference between “No treatment" and “Only 
RT”( p = 0.7). In strongly methylated (“MGMT 2”) group, 
significant differences between “Any TMZ therapy” and 
both “No treatment” and “Only RT” was observed (Any 
TMZ therapy vs. No treatment: p  = 1.66e-10; Any TMZ 
therapy vs. Only RT: p -value = 0.0001) with no sig-
nificant differences between “No Treatment” and “Only 
RT”(p  = 0.68). Overall, Methylated tumors (“MGMT 1 and 
2”) showed significant differences in survival with “Any 
TMZ therapy” as opposed to “No treatment” or “Only RT” 
category(Any TMZ therapy vs. No treatment: p  = 2.38e-
14; Any TMZ therapy vs. Only RT: p = 3.01e-07) (Fig.  3).Cox proportional hazard model
The survival analysis was fitted into a cox proportional haz-
ard model with the data variables of age, WHO pre-operative 
performance status, Ki67%, MGMT, treatment, ATRX status 
and gender categories (Figure) (Fig.  4). A positive coefficient 
(coef = 0.02, p = 0.02) was observed with age indicating as the 
age increased, the survival of these patients decreased. The 
exponentiated coefficient for age was 1.02 indicating that each 
additional year of age increased the hazard of shorter length 
of overall survival by 2%. A negative coefficient (coef = -0.30; 
p = 0.01) was observed with the MGMT categories (0,1,2) 
indicating as the MGMT methylation increased, the length 
of overall survival also increased. The exponentiated coeffi-
cient for MGMT status was 0.74 indicating that each change

temic treatment and a statistically significant difference is observed in 
methylated groups receiving any form of treatment as compared to no 
systemic treatment. (MGMT: O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltrans-

   394  Page 6 of 9
in methylation category from unmethylated to borderline to 
strongly methylated was associated with a 26% lower risk of 
shorter overall survival (hazard decreases by a factor of 0.74). 
Similarly, a negative coefficient (coef = -0.39, p  < 0.005) was 
observed for various treatment categories (0: no treatment, 1: 
CRT, 2: CRT + adjuvant TMZ, 3: only chemotherapy, 4: only 
radiotherapy, 5: CRT + adjuvant TMZ + second line therapy) 
indicating survival benefit as compared to no treatment. There 
was no statistical significance observed for other covariates 
(performance status, Ki67%, ATRX, gender). The concord-
ance index for the model was 0.72 and the -log2(p) value was 33.98 indicating the model as a whole has statistically signifi-
cant predictive power for predicting overall survival.
Discussion
Summary of findings
In this study, we identified that MGMT methylation 
impacted on the overall survival of inoperable IDH-
wildtype glioblastoma undergoing systemic treatment,

regardless of the treatment modality. This study is the 
largest sample size retrospective study in the current 
post-WHO-classification-2021 era for investigating the 
MGMT methylation impact in survival of this subgroup 
of patients. A higher methylation status was associated 
with a higher chance of longer overall survival. There 
were significant survival differences between patients 
who underwent systemic treatment with highest impact 
made by strong MGMT methylation (> 15%) in patients 
receiving EORTC-NCIC protocol along with second line 
treatment as compared to other treatment options and 
methylation statuses. There were survival benefits noted 
within other groups of systemic therapy too despite not 
achieving statistical significance in those groups, given 
the relatively small numbers in each group. The statisti-
cal significance was, however, observed when complete or 
incomplete EORTC-NCIC protocols were pooled together 
along with pooling of any TMZ therapy. The survival tail 
for strongly methylated tumors was also longer for both the 
treatment groups that had EORTC-NCIC protocol and/or 
second line treatment.
We further devised a cox proportional hazard model 
that predicted the overall survival of these inoperable IDH-
wildtype glioblastoma based on the statistically significant 
predictor variables namely MGMT status and treatment 
categories.Limitations
This study, while providing valuable insights, is limited by 
several factors. Firstly, it is a single-center study, which may 
not capture the full variability of patient populations and 
treatment responses seen across different institutions. Sec-
ondly, its retrospective nature introduces potential biases and 
limits the ability to establish causal relationships between 
treatments and outcomes. The limited sample size further 
restricts the generalizability of the findings and may affect 
the statistical power of the conclusions drawn. To overcome 
these limitations, a prospective study design followed by a 
multicenter clinical trial is essential. This approach would 
facilitate the collection of high-quality, standardized data 
and enable a more comprehensive assessment of treatment 
efficacy and safety. Achieving level one evidence through 
such rigorous research will provide robust support for the 
management of patients with inoperable glioblastoma, who 
currently have limited standard of care treatment options.
Current evidence in the field
There remains a dearth of studies on impact of MGMT 
methylation of unresectable IDH- wildtype glioblas -
toma patients after WHO 2021 updated classification 
[1]. There has been few retrospective studies prior to the 
Fig. 4  Cox proportional hazard model with reference to overall sur -
vival. There is statistically significant impact of treatment categories 
and MGMT methylation categories on overall survival. The model 
indicates statistically significant increase in hazard (shorter survival) 
with age; decrease in hazard (longer survival) with increasing MGMT 
methylation and with categories of systemic therapy. A good predic-
tive power of the model is indicated by concordance of 0.72 and the 
-log2(p) value of 33.98 in the log-likelihood ratio test indicates strong evidence that the model is useful in predicting survival. a Coefficient

classification demonstrating the impact of MGMT meth-
ylation status on overall survival of these tumors. A 2023 
report from the RANO resect group [9 ] have identified 
that patients undergoing biopsy only had least favorable 
PFS (5 months, CI:4–6, p  = 0.001) and OS (10 months, 
CI:8–12, p = 0.001) post receiving EORTC-NICIC proto-
col as compared to other resection groups. They went on 
to have different types of second line therapy (resection 
and/or other therapy, only RT, only TMZ, only lomustine, 
RT + TMZ or lomustine or others). They factored in the 
MGMT status in the univariate (unmethylated: HR:1.53, 
CI:1.3–1.9; p = 0.001) and multivariate analysis (p  < 0.05) 
showing persistent significant impact on OS with worse 
prognosis in unmethylated tumors consistent with our 
results [9 ]. A 2011 retrospective study showed the MGMT 
promoter methylation was the strongest favorable predictor 
for overall survival in unresectable glioblastoma patients 
(OS, median: 20.3 vs. 7.3 months, p  < 0.001, HR 0.30, 
95% CI 0.16–0.55), and PFS (median: 15.0 vs. 6.1 months, 
p < 0.001, HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17–0.57) and was also asso -
ciated with higher frequencies of treatment response and 
prolonged post-recurrence survival (PRS, median: 4.5 
vs. 1.4 months, p < 0.002, HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21–0.71) 
[13]. Another study of unresectable thalamic glioblastoma 
with MGMT methylation showed improved survival with 
chemo-radiotherapy [5 ]. This subgroup of patients have 
now been addressed as a separate entity requiring focused 
study of treatment options [4 , 10, 11]. In another single 
centre retrospective study, MGMT methylation status was 
an independent factor for hazard risk for overall survival in 
these patients who underwent biopsy independent of treat-
ment and radiotherapy alone was seen to improve survival 
in these subgroups of patients [7 ].
Implications for clinical practice
MGMT methylation acts as a predictive biomarker for 
overall survival in unresectable IDH-wildtype glioblas -
toma patients undergoing systemic therapy following a 
diagnostic biopsy. Tailoring systemic treatment for these 
methylated patients can have positive impact on survival 
and quality of life.
